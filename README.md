Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin. Also taking reference from Andrej Karpathy's repository.

Dataset: "Friends" Serial transcript.

# Version 1 : 
Here, the text is tokenised according to characters. Considering lowercase, uppercase and special characters, we have just under a 100 tokens.

# Version 2 :
Now, tokenisation is performed word-wise. now the entire transcript has 1154596 words. Since we are making each unique word a token, we have 27768 tokens.
